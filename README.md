# The Dogfood Manifesto

I believe that our ruling bodies should govern for the good of the masses and that the only way that can happen successfully is if they have to rely on the services that make up our nation.  As the phrase goes in tech, they need to be dogfooding.  This means that how our elected MPs work, live and are paid need to change, they need to have to rely on the services that they are there to improve for the rest of us.

Thus, I suggest...


## Living and working in their constituency

MPs maintain constituency offices and only constituency offices.  All funding (staff etc) must be spent in the constituency and no family or friends should be employed.

MPs must live in the constituency.  This is most easily achieved if that is where they are already based there.

## No private health insurance

For them and their immediate family.  The NHS should work for everybody, in a timely manner.

## Children go to the local school, no selection, no fees

Most people don't have a huge amount of options which school they go to and they have to apply to the schools in their catchment area.  The same should be true for MPs.  There may well be fee paying or selective schools in the area, but the basic option should be suitable for everybody.


## No external income other than investments you had before

If MPs are being paid, directly or indirectly, by 3rd parties, they are not putting all their professional time and energy into the business of improving the country.  They may also not be thinking clearly about their priorities if somebody other than the public is paying them.

MPs should publish their tax returns to show this.  When they leave office they should publish their returns for the next five years so make sure that there is no temptation for delayed returns.

## 180k a year, tracking minimum wage.

Being an MP is a difficult job and requires a high degree of skill and dedication.  We should recognise this and pay them as well (better maybe) as they would be in other jobs which they might be suitable for.  Pay should track the minimum wage, thus remaining comparable over time.
