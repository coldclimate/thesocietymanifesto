# The Society Manifesto

I believe that our ruling bodies should govern for the good of the masses and that the only way that can happen successfully is if they have to rely on the services that make up our society. This means that how our elected MPs work, live and are paid needs to change, they need to have to rely on the services that they are there to improve for the rest of us.

Many MPs cite [The 7 Principals Of Pubic Life](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2), often refereed to as the [Nolan principals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Committee_on_Standards_in_Public_Life) and The Society Manifesto aims to align with these principals, making them real. [Selflessness](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2#selflessness), [Integrity](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2#integrity), [Objectivity](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2#objectivity), [Accountability](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2#accountability), [Openness](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2#openness), [Honesty](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2#honesty) and [Leadership](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/the-7-principles-of-public-life/the-7-principles-of-public-life--2#leadership)

My hope is UK politicians pledge to live and work in a way that creates and reinforces a positive feedback loop.  Leadership comes from living your principals, not saying you do.


## No private health insurance

The NHS is key to British society and was founded on three principles 

* That it meet the needs of everyone
* That it be free at the point of delivery
* That it be based on clinical need, not ability to pay

To maintain this, no MP should have private health insurance, for them and their immediate family. The NHS should work for everybody.

## Children go to the local school, no selection, no fees

Every child deserves the chance at a great education but the majority of people don't have many options for where their children go to school, relying on the schools in their catchment area. The same should be true for MPs. There may well be fee-paying or selective schools in the area, but the basic option should be suitable for everybody.

## No external income other than investments you had before

If MPs are being paid, directly or indirectly, by 3rd parties, they are not putting all their professional time and energy into the business of improving the country. They may also not be thinking clearly about their priorities if somebody other than the public is paying them.

MPs should publish their tax returns to show this. When they leave office they should publish their returns for the next five years so make sure that there is no temptation for delayed returns.

## Â£120k a year, tracking minimum wage.

Being an MP is a difficult job and requires a high degree of skill and dedication. We should recognise this and pay them as well (better maybe) as they would be in other jobs which they might be suitable for. Pay should track the minimum wage, thus remaining comparable over time.

## Living and working in their constituency

MPs maintain constituency offices and only constituency offices. All funding (staff etc) must be spent in the constituency.

MPs must live in the constituency. This is most easily achieved if that is where they are already based there.

Travel costs and accommodation expenses will be paid, including rental properties, but no second homes.

## Outbound communication through official channels

When MPs publish articles in specific newspapers, sometimes behind paywall, they are not on any official record, and not everybody can access them.

Should MPs want to make and publish public statements these should be made through official channels.  Fair and easy access should apply to all public communication.

# Who has pledged so far?

Nobody yet, but as MPs and candidates do, I'll list them here.  To pledge they need to link to this website from their own.
